        <hr />

        <div id="commands" class="command">
            <h4>Commands</h4>
            <p>
                The main usage of Beta 42 is directly calling commands.<br />
                This is done simply by sending a message that starts with <code>=</code>. 
                There are ways to <a href="bot.html#alias">assign an alternate call</a> character, but <code>=</code> will always work.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Command Syntax:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>All commands start with an = or appropiate <a href="bot.html#alias">alias</a></li>
                    <li>Any elements in 'single quotes' are arguments</li>
                    <li>Any elements without quotes are subcommands</li>
                    <li>Any args in ['square brackets'] are optional. This does not mean you need to write in the brackets</li>
                </ul>
                Any args that contain spaces should be wrapped in either 'single quotes', "double quotes" or «double angle quotes»
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr />

        <div id="auto" class="command">
            <h4>Automatic Functions</h4>
            <p>
                Beta 42 has a set of automatic functions that do not require a command to trigger.<br />
                These are all optional and can be set with the correct command, such as using <code><a href="fun.html/#ayy">=ayy</a></code> to disable the bot responding to mentions.
                A full list of automatic functionality can be found <a href="autofunc.html">here</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr />

        <div id="bugs" class="command">
            <h4>Bug Reports and Feature Suggestions</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Bug reports:</b><br />
                Every command within Beta 42 will send a reply, whether that reply is a successful response or an error message.<br />
                If a response isn't sent, it means one of two things have happened:<br />
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The command call was blocked by an <a href="#auth">authority check</a> and is still on cooldown.</li>
                <li>The command is bugged.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If it is the latter, then it would be greatly appreciated if you could send it to <span class="mention">@squaswin</span> 
                either in DMs or <a href="http://www.discord.me/kiwibots">Kiwi Hangout</a>. <span class="mention">#reeds-station</span> is designed specifically for reporting bugs.<br />
                <del>And I know Beta 42 has some bugs...</del><br />
                <br />
                <b>Suggestions:</b><br />
                Is there something you need but don't have or don't know how to do? Head over to the server linked above and ask in <span class="mention">#heinrichs-workshop</span>.<br />
                If we have a solution, we can tell you there and then, if not, we can suggest a bot or squas may be able to implement a solution into Beta 42 for you.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr />

        <div id="auth" class="command">
            <h4>Authority Checks</h4>
            <p>
                Beta 42 implements a suite of authority checks to help curb abuse and help server moderators combat spam. There are currently 6 checks:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Permission Levels</li>
                <li>Ratelimits</li>
                <li>Spamlimits</li>
                <li>Server Toggles</li>
                <li>Bot Bans</li>
                <li>Global Bans</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                When a check is failed, Beta 42 will alert the user as to what went wrong and will then start ignoring any more permission errors caused by that user for one minute.<br />
                This is to stop botbanned members from spamming "You are botbanned" messages.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Permission Levels:</b><br />
                Permission levels are non-changable and are defined on a command by command basis. 
                They exist to stop people using the bot to bypass certain safety features within discord, 
                such as preventing users without Manage Roles from creating giveme roles so that they can grant themselves roles.<br />
                Each command will have its permission level displayed next to the name<br />
            </p>
            Here is a list of permissions on the bot:
            <ul>
                <li class="no-bullet"><b>Server Permissions</b>. These are granted through having a particular permission on a users roles.</li>
                <li><b>[Server Owner]</b>: This is the big man, woman or wumpus in charge of the server.</li>
                <li><b>[Server Admin]</b>: Admins are members with Manage Roles.</li>
                <li><b>[Server Manager]</b>: Managers are members with Manage Channels.</li>
                <li><b>[Server Moderator]</b>: Moderators are members with Manage Messages.</li>
                <li><b>[Kick]</b> and <b>[Ban]</b>: Self explanatory, members with the named permissions.</li>
                <li class="no-bullet"><b>Bot Permissions</b>. These allow servers to grant normal users an elevated level of power over the bot without granting general permissions.</li>
                <li><b>[Bot Admin]</b>: These are members who have a role called "Best Friends". Server admins can also use these commands.</li>
                <li><b>[Bot Mod]</b>: These are members who have a role called "Friends". Server mods can also use these commands.</li>
                <li class="no-bullet"><b>Special Permissions</b>. There are some specialised permissions used within Beta 42. Any not listed below will be explained when they are used.</li>
                <li><b>[Owner]</b>: This refers to squaswin himself. Commands locked to Owner are generally for the wellbeing of the bot.</li>
                <li><b>[Buds]</b>: This is only given to a few of squas' close friends. If you ask for buds, you will not get buds.</li>
                <li><b>[No DM]</b>: These mark commands that cannot be used inside private or direct channels. If a command has any other permission, assume it has this too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Any command not marked with a permission level can be used by anyone.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Rate Limits:</b><br />
                Rate limits are also fixed by the bot. This stops both spam in servers and stress on the bot herself.
                If a command is rate limited, it will be marked so on its help article next to the permission check.
                If no indication exists, then the command is not rate limited.<br />
                <b>THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION TO START SPAMMING THE BOT.</b> All spamming like this will do is get you or your server sanctioned.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Spam Limits:</b><br />
                This is the first check that can be set by the server managers via a <a href="mod.html#spamlimit">command</a>.<br />
                It enforces a limit to the amount of lines the bot can send to a single non-bot channel within a timeframe, but this is explained in the command's page.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Server Toggles:</b><br />
                This is the largest amount of control servers have over the bot's usage as it allows them to <a href="bot.html#toggle">completely disable commands</a>.<br />
                Commands that are toggled will have a <code>[Disabled by server]</code> tag applied to the end of the built in help command.<br />
                Users who have any server related permissions are not affected by disabled commands.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Botbans:</b><br />
                Botbans are a servers last level of control, or rather defence. It allows them to stop a given user from accessing any of the bot's commands.<br />
                Botbans applied in one server are not respected in any other servers, and unlike her predecessor, Beta 42 will not automatically globalban people with too many botbans.<br />
                You cannot botban the server owner or other bots and you cannot botban squas.<br />
                In general, botbans only affect command calls, not automatic functions.<br />
                <br />
                <b>Global Bans:</b><br />
                Global bans are the absolute last resort for cleaning up a mess. They can only be applied and removed by squaswin and can affect either single users or entire servers.<br />
                If a user is global banned, they will not be able to use Beta 42's commands in any server or private channel.<br />
                If a server is global blocked, the bot will refuse to join the server and if she does get on the server, she will leave at the first opportunity.

        <div id="language" class="command">
            <h4>Languages and Coverage</h4>
            <p>
                While Beta 42 does have facilities to load in different language files, no alternate language files currently exist, 
                and until she is finalised and no more changes are to be made, no files will be created.<br />
                Beta 42 is currently somewhat in a state of feature limbo, and until she is stable, language files will be painful to create 
                just because of the amount of updates that will be required in the immediate future.

            <h4>Username Resolution</h4>
            <p>
                A lot of commands accept a user as an argument. For these args, you can pass any of the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>User Mention (@Beta 42)</li>
                    <li>Discord Tag (Beta 42#3979)</li>
                    <li>Username (Beta 42)</li>
                    <!-- 
                        mweheheh look at me revealing secrets in the website like its nothing.
                        Changing B42's nickname to this while "Respond to Pings" is turned on in =ayy makes her actually

                        -->
                    <li>Nickname (Ping for Free Hugs)</li>

                    <li>Role Mention (@Bots)</li>
                </ul>
                If multiple users are found, or a role has multiple users, then she will ask for who you meant.<br />
                If no names match a user perfectly, she will attempt to find people with a similar name or nickname.<br />
                <br />
                Usually args of <code>'user'</code> or <code>'member'</code> are what is affected.

        <div id="tulpa" class="command">
            <h4>Tulpa Compliancy</h4>
            <p>
                Beta 42 supports being able to process messages sent through alternate users of accounts.<br />
                The way this works is that if a message matches a compliancy, the compliancy will be removed from the message before it is processed.<br />
                List of current compliancies: (All resolve to "command")
                <ul>
                    <li><code>[command]</code></li>
                    <li><code>[&lt;whitespace&gt;command&lt;whitespace&gt;]</code></li>
                    <li><code>{command}</code></li>
                    <li><code>{&lt;whitespace&gt;command&lt;whitespace&gt;}</code></li>
                    <li><code>//command</code></li>
                    <li><code>//&lt;whitespace&gt;command</code></li>
                </ul>
                Because I update the message itself, this means that the compliant version will be used for commands that rely on past messages, such as <code>=remove</code> and <code>=modlog</code>
