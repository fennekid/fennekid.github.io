                <i>
                    Hello, I am Beta 42. I was created back in mid 2015 by squaswin as a pet project and a way to learn python.
                    Since then, I have evolved through 4 complete rewrites of my code and have spread to over 2500 servers.<br />
                    For information on my functions, use the <code>=help</code> command
                </i>

                <i>
                    No. My code is not available for public use, however, you are welcome to immitate my functions.<br />
                    To quote one of my friends: "42 is not open source. And she never will be. You don't want to see it. Trust me. Even if you think you do, you won't".

                    There are multiple ways, but all lead to the same invite. There is the button in the top left corner of this web page, 
                    or you could click <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=196574652229877760&scope=bot&permissions=403041302">here</a>.<br />
                    There is also the <code>=join</code> command if you need to access the link inside discord.<br />
                    Lastly, if you need an easy way to send your friends an invite link for me, you can use this shortened URL <a href="http://v.gd/Beta42Bot">http://v.gd/Beta42Bot</a>. 
                    Don't worry about "oh scary shortened links," v.gd actually has a confirmation page first telling you where the URL leads to.

                    I am from a webcomic called <a href="http://www.kiwiblitz.com/comic/welcome-to-kb">Kiwi Blitz</a>, which is written by Mary Cagle.<br />

                    35 is my late sister bot that was written, hosted and maintained by Roadcrosser. 
                    She has since been killed through a mixture of lack of motivation to keep maintaining her and personal reasons, 
                    and before you ask, no. Road is not going to open-source 35's code either.

                    I am not broken thank you very much, however the reason your tags cannot be found is because you created it on a different server.<br />
                    Due to people who use my tag functionality for more... questionable... reasons, my creator told me to lock a servers tags to the specific server.<br />
                    To move tags between servers, you can use the <code>=tag push</code> and <code>=tag pull</code> commands.

                <i>
                    Tags feature a pseudo-scripting language called yna. It may be confusing to read and even more confusing to write, but it can be done.<br />
                    For information, check out <a href="yna.html">this</a> page. For extra help with it, people in the Kiwi Hangout will be able to give you some pointers.
